# LWC boilerplate

The most barebone LWC setup for simple experiments and bug reproductions.

```s
pnpm install
```

```sh
$ pnpm run build             # Build app (production mode)
$ pnpm run start             # Run (production mode)
$ pnpm run dev               # Build, run, and watch (dev mode)
```

The app is hosted in `localhost:3000`.
