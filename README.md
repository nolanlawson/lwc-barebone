# LWC boilerplate

The most barebone LWC setup for simple experiments and bug reproductions.

```sh
$ yarn build             # Build app (production mode)
$ yarn start             # Run (production mode)
$ yarn dev               # Build, run, and watch (dev mode)
```

The app is hosted in `localhost:3000`.
